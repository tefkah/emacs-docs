In Emacs Lisp, certain symbols normally evaluate to themselves. These include `nil` and `t`, as well as any symbol whose name starts with ‘`:`’ (these are called *keywords*). These symbols cannot be rebound, nor can their values be changed. Any attempt to set or bind `nil` or `t` signals a `setting-constant` error. The same is true for a keyword (a symbol whose name starts with ‘`:`’), if it is interned in the standard obarray, except that setting such a symbol to itself is not an error.

```lisp
nil ≡ 'nil
     ⇒ nil
```

```lisp
(setq nil 500)
error→ Attempt to set constant symbol: nil
```

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **keywordp** *object*

function returns `t` if `object` is a symbol whose name starts with ‘`:`’, interned in the standard obarray, and returns `nil` otherwise.

These constants are fundamentally different from the constants defined using the `defconst` special form (see [Defining Variables](/docs/elisp/Defining-Variables)). A `defconst` form serves to inform human readers that you do not intend to change the value of a variable, but Emacs does not raise an error if you actually change it.

A small number of additional symbols are made read-only for various practical reasons. These include `enable-multibyte-characters`, `most-positive-fixnum`, `most-negative-fixnum`, and a few others. Any attempt to set or bind these also signals a `setting-constant` error.
