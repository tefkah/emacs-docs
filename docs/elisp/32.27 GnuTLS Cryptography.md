If compiled with GnuTLS, Emacs offers built-in cryptographic support. Following the GnuTLS API terminology, the available tools are digests, MACs, symmetric ciphers, and AEAD ciphers.

The terms used herein, such as IV (Initialization Vector), require some familiarity with cryptography and will not be defined in detail. Please consult [https://www.gnutls.org/](https://www.gnutls.org/) for specific documentation which may help you understand the terminology and structure of the GnuTLS library.
