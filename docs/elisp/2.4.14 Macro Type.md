A *Lisp macro* is a user-defined construct that extends the Lisp language. It is represented as an object much like a function, but with different argument-passing semantics. A Lisp macro has the form of a list whose first element is the symbol `macro` and whose CDR is a Lisp function object, including the `lambda` symbol.

Lisp macro objects are usually defined with the built-in `defmacro` macro, but any list that begins with `macro` is a macro as far as Emacs is concerned. See [Macros](Macros), for an explanation of how to write a macro.

**Warning**: Lisp macros and keyboard macros (see [Keyboard Macros](Keyboard-Macros)) are entirely different things. When we use the word “macro" without qualification, we mean a Lisp macro, not a keyboard macro.
