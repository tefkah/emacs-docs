GNU Emacs supports two numeric data types: *integers* and *floating-point numbers*. Integers are whole numbers such as -3, 0, 7, 13, and 511. Floating-point numbers are numbers with fractional parts, such as -4.5, 0.0, and 2.71828. They can also be expressed in exponential notation: ‘`1.5e2`’ is the same as ‘`150.0`’; here, ‘`e2`’ stands for ten to the second power, and that is multiplied by 1.5. Integer computations are exact. Floating-point computations often involve rounding errors, as the numbers have a fixed amount of precision.
