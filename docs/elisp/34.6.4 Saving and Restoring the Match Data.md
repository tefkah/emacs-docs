slug: Saving-Match-Data
---

When you call a function that may search, you may need to save and restore the match data around that call, if you want to preserve the match data from an earlier search for later use. Here is an example that shows the problem that arises if you fail to save the match data:

```lisp
(re-search-forward "The \\(cat \\)")
     ⇒ 48
(foo)                   ; foo does more searching.
(match-end 0)
     ⇒ 61              ; Unexpected result—not 48!
```

You can save and restore the match data with `save-match-data`:

### <span className="tag macro">`macro`</span> **save-match-data** *body…*

This macro executes `body`, saving and restoring the match data around it. The return value is the value of the last form in `body`.

You could use `set-match-data` together with `match-data` to imitate the effect of the special form `save-match-data`. Here is how:

```lisp
(let ((data (match-data)))
  (unwind-protect
      …   ; Ok to change the original match data.
    (set-match-data data)))
```

Emacs automatically saves and restores the match data when it runs process filter functions (see [Filter Functions](Filter-Functions)) and process sentinels (see [Sentinels](Sentinels)).
