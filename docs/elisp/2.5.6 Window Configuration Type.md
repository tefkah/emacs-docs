A *window configuration* stores information about the positions, sizes, and contents of the windows in a frame, so you can recreate the same arrangement of windows later.

Window configurations do not have a read syntax; their print syntax looks like ‘`#<window-configuration>`’. See [Window Configurations](Window-Configurations), for a description of several functions related to window configurations.
