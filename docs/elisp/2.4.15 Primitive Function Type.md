A *primitive function* is a function callable from Lisp but written in the C programming language. Primitive functions are also called *subrs* or *built-in functions*. (The word “subr" is derived from “subroutine".) Most primitive functions evaluate all their arguments when they are called. A primitive function that does not evaluate all its arguments is called a *special form* (see [Special Forms](/docs/elisp/Special-Forms)).

It does not matter to the caller of a function whether the function is primitive. However, this does matter if you try to redefine a primitive with a function written in Lisp. The reason is that the primitive function may be called directly from C code. Calls to the redefined function from Lisp will use the new definition, but calls from C code may still use the built-in definition. Therefore, **we discourage redefinition of primitive functions**.

The term *function* refers to all Emacs functions, whether written in Lisp or C. See [Function Type](/docs/elisp/Function-Type), for information about the functions written in Lisp.

Primitive functions have no read syntax and print in hash notation with the name of the subroutine.

```lisp
(symbol-function 'car)          ; Access the function cell
                                ;   of the symbol.
     ⇒ #<subr car>
(subrp (symbol-function 'car))  ; Is this a primitive function?
     ⇒ t                       ; Yes.
```
