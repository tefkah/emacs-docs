Suppose we would like to define a Lisp construct to increment a variable value, much like the `++` operator in C. We would like to write `(inc x)` and have the effect of `(setq x (1+ x))`. Here’s a macro definition that does the job:

```lisp
(defmacro inc (var)
   (list 'setq var (list '1+ var)))
```

When this is called with `(inc x)`, the argument `var` is the symbol `x`—*not* the *value* of `x`, as it would be in a function. The body of the macro uses this to construct the expansion, which is `(setq x (1+ x))`. Once the macro definition returns this expansion, Lisp proceeds to evaluate it, thus incrementing `x`.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **macrop** *object*

This predicate tests whether its argument is a macro, and returns `t` if so, `nil` otherwise.
