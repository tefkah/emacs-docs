slug: Archive-Web-Server
---

A web server providing access to a package archive must support the following queries:

### archive-contents

Return a lisp form describing the archive contents. The form is a list of ’package-desc’ structures (see `package.el`), except the first element of the list is the archive version.

### ﹤package name﹥-readme.txt

Return the long description of the package.

### ﹤file name﹥.sig

Return the signature for the file.

### ﹤file name﹥

Return the file. This will be the tarball for a multi-file package, or the single file for a simple package.
