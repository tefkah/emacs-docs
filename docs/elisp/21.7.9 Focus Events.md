slug: Focus-Events

Window systems provide general ways for the user to control which window gets keyboard input. This choice of window is called the *focus*. When the user does something to switch between Emacs frames, that generates a *focus event*. The normal definition of a focus event, in the global keymap, is to select a new frame within Emacs, as the user would expect. See [Input Focus](Input-Focus), which also describes hooks related to focus events.

Focus events are represented in Lisp as lists that look like this:

```lisp
(switch-frame new-frame)
```

where `new-frame` is the frame switched to.

Some X window managers are set up so that just moving the mouse into a window is enough to set the focus there. Usually, there is no need for a Lisp program to know about the focus change until some other kind of input arrives. Emacs generates a focus event only when the user actually types a keyboard key or presses a mouse button in the new frame; just moving the mouse between frames does not generate a focus event.

A focus event in the middle of a key sequence would garble the sequence. So Emacs never generates a focus event in the middle of a key sequence. If the user changes focus in the middle of a key sequence—that is, after a prefix key—then Emacs reorders the events so that the focus event comes either before or after the multi-event key sequence, and not within it.
