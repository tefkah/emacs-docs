### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **overlays-at** *pos \&optional sorted*

This function returns a list of all the overlays that cover the character at position `pos` in the current buffer. If `sorted` is non-`nil`, the list is in decreasing order of priority, otherwise it is in no particular order. An overlay contains position `pos` if it begins at or before `pos`, and ends after `pos`.

To illustrate usage, here is a Lisp function that returns a list of the overlays that specify property `prop` for the character at point:

```lisp
(defun find-overlays-specifying (prop)
  (let ((overlays (overlays-at (point)))
        found)
    (while overlays
      (let ((overlay (car overlays)))
        (if (overlay-get overlay prop)
            (setq found (cons overlay found))))
      (setq overlays (cdr overlays)))
    found))
```

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **overlays-in** *beg end*

This function returns a list of the overlays that overlap the region `beg` through `end`. An overlay overlaps with a region if it contains one or more characters in the region; empty overlays (see [empty overlay](/docs/elisp/Managing-Overlays)) overlap if they are at `beg`, strictly between `beg` and `end`, or at `end` when `end` denotes the position at the end of the buffer.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **next-overlay-change** *pos*

This function returns the buffer position of the next beginning or end of an overlay, after `pos`. If there is none, it returns `(point-max)`.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **previous-overlay-change** *pos*

This function returns the buffer position of the previous beginning or end of an overlay, before `pos`. If there is none, it returns `(point-min)`.

As an example, here’s a simplified (and inefficient) version of the primitive function `next-single-char-property-change` (see [Property Search](/docs/elisp/Property-Search)). It searches forward from position `pos` for the next position where the value of a given property `prop`, as obtained from either overlays or text properties, changes.

```lisp
(defun next-single-char-property-change (position prop)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char position)
    (let ((propval (get-char-property (point) prop)))
      (while (and (not (eobp))
                  (eq (get-char-property (point) prop) propval))
        (goto-char (min (next-overlay-change (point))
                        (next-single-property-change (point) prop)))))
    (point)))
```
