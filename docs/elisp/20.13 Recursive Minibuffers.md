These functions and variables deal with recursive minibuffers (see [Recursive Editing](/docs/elisp/Recursive-Editing)):

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **minibuffer-depth**

This function returns the current depth of activations of the minibuffer, a nonnegative integer. If no minibuffers are active, it returns zero.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **enable-recursive-minibuffers**

If this variable is non-`nil`, you can invoke commands (such as `find-file`) that use minibuffers even while the minibuffer is active. Such invocation produces a recursive editing level for a new minibuffer. The outer-level minibuffer is invisible while you are editing the inner one.

If this variable is `nil`, you cannot invoke minibuffer commands when the minibuffer is active, not even if you switch to another window to do it.

If a command name has a property `enable-recursive-minibuffers` that is non-`nil`, then the command can use the minibuffer to read arguments even if it is invoked from the minibuffer. A command can also achieve this by binding `enable-recursive-minibuffers` to `t` in the interactive declaration (see [Using Interactive](/docs/elisp/Using-Interactive)). The minibuffer command `next-matching-history-element` (normally `M-s` in the minibuffer) does the latter.
