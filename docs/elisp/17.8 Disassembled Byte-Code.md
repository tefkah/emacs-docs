slug: Disassembly

People do not write byte-code; that job is left to the byte compiler. But we provide a disassembler to satisfy a cat-like curiosity. The disassembler converts the byte-compiled code into human-readable form.

The byte-code interpreter is implemented as a simple stack machine. It pushes values onto a stack of its own, then pops them off to use them in calculations whose results are themselves pushed back on the stack. When a byte-code function returns, it pops a value off the stack and returns it as the value of the function.

In addition to the stack, byte-code functions can use, bind, and set ordinary Lisp variables, by transferring values between variables and the stack.

### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **disassemble** *object \&optional buffer-or-name*

This command displays the disassembled code for `object`. In interactive use, or if `buffer-or-name` is `nil` or omitted, the output goes in a buffer named `*Disassemble*`. If `buffer-or-name` is non-`nil`, it must be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer. Then the output goes there, at point, and point is left before the output.

The argument `object` can be a function name, a lambda expression (see [Lambda Expressions](/docs/elisp/Lambda-Expressions)), or a byte-code object (see [Byte-Code Objects](/docs/elisp/Byte_002dCode-Objects)). If it is a lambda expression, `disassemble` compiles it and disassembles the resulting compiled code.

Here are two examples of using the `disassemble` function. We have added explanatory comments to help you relate the byte-code to the Lisp source; these do not appear in the output of `disassemble`.

```lisp
(defun factorial (integer)
  "Compute factorial of an integer."
  (if (= 1 integer) 1
    (* integer (factorial (1- integer)))))
     ⇒ factorial
```



```lisp
(factorial 4)
     ⇒ 24
```



```lisp
(disassemble 'factorial)
     -| byte-code for factorial:
 doc: Compute factorial of an integer.
 args: (integer)
```



```lisp
0   varref   integer      ; Get the value of integer and
                          ;   push it onto the stack.
1   constant 1            ; Push 1 onto stack.
```

```lisp
2   eqlsign               ; Pop top two values off stack, compare
                          ;   them, and push result onto stack.
```

```lisp
3   goto-if-nil 1         ; Pop and test top of stack;
                          ;   if nil, go to 1, else continue.
6   constant 1            ; Push 1 onto top of stack.
7   return                ; Return the top element of the stack.
```

```lisp
8:1 varref   integer      ; Push value of integer onto stack.
9   constant factorial    ; Push factorial onto stack.
10  varref   integer      ; Push value of integer onto stack.
11  sub1                  ; Pop integer, decrement value,
                          ;   push new value onto stack.
12  call     1            ; Call function factorial using first
                          ;   (i.e., top) stack element as argument;
                          ;   push returned value onto stack.
```

```lisp
13 mult                   ; Pop top two values off stack, multiply
                          ;   them, and push result onto stack.
14 return                 ; Return the top element of the stack.
```

The `silly-loop` function is somewhat more complex:

```lisp
(defun silly-loop (n)
  "Return time before and after N iterations of a loop."
  (let ((t1 (current-time-string)))
    (while (> (setq n (1- n))
              0))
    (list t1 (current-time-string))))
     ⇒ silly-loop
```



```lisp
(disassemble 'silly-loop)
     -| byte-code for silly-loop:
 doc: Return time before and after N iterations of a loop.
 args: (n)
```



```lisp
0   constant current-time-string  ; Push current-time-string
                                  ;   onto top of stack.
```

```lisp
1   call     0            ; Call current-time-string with no
                          ;   argument, push result onto stack.
```

```lisp
2   varbind  t1           ; Pop stack and bind t1 to popped value.
```

```lisp
3:1 varref   n            ; Get value of n from the environment
                          ;   and push the value on the stack.
4   sub1                  ; Subtract 1 from top of stack.
```

```lisp
5   dup                   ; Duplicate top of stack; i.e., copy the top
                          ;   of the stack and push copy onto stack.
6   varset   n            ; Pop the top of the stack,
                          ;   and bind n to the value.

;; (In effect, the sequence dup varset copies the top of the stack
;; into the value of n without popping it.)
```



```lisp
7   constant 0            ; Push 0 onto stack.
8   gtr                   ; Pop top two values off stack,
                          ;   test if n is greater than 0
                          ;   and push result onto stack.
```

```lisp
9   goto-if-not-nil 1     ; Goto 1 if n > 0
                          ;   (this continues the while loop)
                          ;   else continue.
```

```lisp
12  varref   t1           ; Push value of t1 onto stack.
13  constant current-time-string  ; Push current-time-string
                                  ;   onto the top of the stack.
14  call     0            ; Call current-time-string again.
```

```lisp
15  unbind   1            ; Unbind t1 in local environment.
16  list2                 ; Pop top two elements off stack, create a
                          ;   list of them, and push it onto stack.
17  return                ; Return value of the top of stack.
```
