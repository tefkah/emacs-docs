Visiting a file means reading a file into a buffer. Once this is done, we say that the buffer is *visiting* that file, and call the file *the visited file* of the buffer.

A file and a buffer are two different things. A file is information recorded permanently in the computer (unless you delete it). A buffer, on the other hand, is information inside of Emacs that will vanish at the end of the editing session (or when you kill the buffer). When a buffer is visiting a file, it contains information copied from the file. The copy in the buffer is what you modify with editing commands. Changes to the buffer do not change the file; to make the changes permanent, you must *save* the buffer, which means copying the altered buffer contents back into the file.

Despite the distinction between files and buffers, people often refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice-versa. Indeed, we say, “I am editing a file", rather than, “I am editing a buffer that I will soon save as a file of the same name". Humans do not usually need to make the distinction explicit. When dealing with a computer program, however, it is good to keep the distinction in mind.
