When you define a user option with `defcustom`, you must specify its *customization type*. That is a Lisp object which describes (1) which values are legitimate and (2) how to display the value in the customization buffer for editing.

You specify the customization type in `defcustom` with the `:type` keyword. The argument of `:type` is evaluated, but only once when the `defcustom` is executed, so it isn’t useful for the value to vary. Normally we use a quoted constant. For example:

```lisp
(defcustom diff-command "diff"
  "The command to use to run diff."
  :type '(string)
  :group 'diff)
```

In general, a customization type is a list whose first element is a symbol, one of the customization type names defined in the following sections. After this symbol come a number of arguments, depending on the symbol. Between the type symbol and its arguments, you can optionally write keyword-value pairs (see [Type Keywords](Type-Keywords)).

Some type symbols do not use any arguments; those are called *simple types*. For a simple type, if you do not use any keyword-value pairs, you can omit the parentheses around the type symbol. For example just `string` as a customization type is equivalent to `(string)`.

All customization types are implemented as widgets; see [Introduction](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/widget.html#Top) in The Emacs Widget Library, for details.
