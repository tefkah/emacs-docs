slug: nil-and-t

In Emacs Lisp, the symbol `nil` has three separate meanings: it is a symbol with the name ‘`nil`’; it is the logical truth value `false`; and it is the empty list—the list of zero elements. When used as a variable, `nil` always has the value `nil`.

As far as the Lisp reader is concerned, ‘`()`’ and ‘`nil`’ are identical: they stand for the same object, the symbol `nil`. The different ways of writing the symbol are intended entirely for human readers. After the Lisp reader has read either ‘`()`’ or ‘`nil`’, there is no way to determine which representation was actually written by the programmer.

In this manual, we write `()` when we wish to emphasize that it means the empty list, and we write `nil` when we wish to emphasize that it means the truth value `false`. That is a good convention to use in Lisp programs also.

```lisp
(cons 'foo ())                ; Emphasize the empty list
(setq foo-flag nil)           ; Emphasize the truth value false
```

In contexts where a truth value is expected, any non-`nil` value is considered to be `true`. However, `t` is the preferred way to represent the truth value `true`. When you need to choose a value that represents `true`, and there is no other basis for choosing, use `t`. The symbol `t` always has the value `t`.

In Emacs Lisp, `nil` and `t` are special symbols that always evaluate to themselves. This is so that you do not need to quote them to use them as constants in a program. An attempt to change their values results in a `setting-constant` error. See [Constant Variables](Constant-Variables).

Return non-`nil` if `object` is one of the two canonical boolean values: `t` or `nil`.
