slug: Printing-Notation

Many of the examples in this manual print text when they are evaluated. If you execute example code in a Lisp Interaction buffer (such as the buffer `*scratch*`) by typing `C-j` after the closing parenthesis of the example, the printed text is inserted into the buffer. If you execute the example by other means (such as by evaluating the function `eval-region`), the printed text is displayed in the echo area.

Examples in this manual indicate printed text with ‘`-|`’, irrespective of where that text goes. The value returned by evaluating the form follows on a separate line with ‘`⇒`’.

```lisp
(progn (prin1 'foo) (princ "\n") (prin1 'bar))
     -| foo
     -| bar
     ⇒ bar
```
