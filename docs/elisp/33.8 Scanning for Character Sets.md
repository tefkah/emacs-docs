slug: Scanning-Charsets

Sometimes it is useful to find out which character set a particular character belongs to. One use for this is in determining which coding systems (see [Coding Systems](Coding-Systems)) are capable of representing all of the text in question; another is to determine the font(s) for displaying that text.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **charset-after** *\&optional pos*

This function returns the charset of highest priority containing the character at position `pos` in the current buffer. If `pos` is omitted or `nil`, it defaults to the current value of point. If `pos` is out of range, the value is `nil`.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **find-charset-region** *beg end \&optional translation*

This function returns a list of the character sets of highest priority that contain characters in the current buffer between positions `beg` and `end`.

The optional argument `translation` specifies a translation table to use for scanning the text (see [Translation of Characters](Translation-of-Characters)). If it is non-`nil`, then each character in the region is translated through this table, and the value returned describes the translated characters instead of the characters actually in the buffer.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **find-charset-string** *string \&optional translation*

This function returns a list of character sets of highest priority that contain characters in `string`. It is just like `find-charset-region`, except that it applies to the contents of `string` instead of part of the current buffer.
