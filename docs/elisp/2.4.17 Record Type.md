slug: Record-Type
---

A *record* is much like a `vector`. However, the first element is used to hold its type as returned by `type-of`. The purpose of records is to allow programmers to create objects with new types that are not built into Emacs.

See [Records](/docs/elisp/Records), for functions that work with records.
