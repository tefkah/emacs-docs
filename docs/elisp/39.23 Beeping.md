slug: Beeping
---

This section describes how to make Emacs ring the bell (or blink the screen) to attract the user’s attention. Be conservative about how often you do this; frequent bells can become irritating. Also be careful not to use just beeping when signaling an error is more appropriate (see [Errors](/docs/elisp/Errors)).

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **ding** *\&optional do-not-terminate*

This function beeps, or flashes the screen (see `visible-bell` below). It also terminates any keyboard macro currently executing unless `do-not-terminate` is non-`nil`.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **beep** *\&optional do-not-terminate*

This is a synonym for `ding`.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **visible-bell**

This variable determines whether Emacs should flash the screen to represent a bell. Non-`nil` means yes, `nil` means no. This is effective on graphical displays, and on text terminals provided the terminal’s Termcap entry defines the visible bell capability (‘`vb`’).

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **ring-bell-function**

If this is non-`nil`, it specifies how Emacs should ring the bell. Its value should be a function of no arguments. If this is non-`nil`, it takes precedence over the `visible-bell` variable.
