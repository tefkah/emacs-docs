A *keymap* maps keys typed by the user to commands. This mapping controls how the user’s command input is executed. A keymap is actually a list whose CAR is the symbol `keymap`.

See [Keymaps](Keymaps), for information about creating keymaps, handling prefix keys, local as well as global keymaps, and changing key bindings.
