slug: Processes-and-Threads

Because threads were a relatively late addition to Emacs Lisp, and due to the way dynamic binding was sometimes used in conjunction with `accept-process-output`, by default a process is locked to the thread that created it. When a process is locked to a thread, output from the process can only be accepted by that thread.

A Lisp program can specify to which thread a process is to be locked, or instruct Emacs to unlock a process, in which case its output can be processed by any thread. Only a single thread will wait for output from a given process at one time—once one thread begins waiting for output, the process is temporarily locked until `accept-process-output` or `sit-for` returns.

If the thread exits, all the processes locked to it are unlocked.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **process-thread** *process*

Return the thread to which `process` is locked. If `process` is unlocked, return `nil`.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **set-process-thread** *process thread*

Set the locking thread of `process` to `thread`. `thread` may be `nil`, in which case the process is unlocked.
