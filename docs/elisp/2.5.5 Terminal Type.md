A *terminal* is a device capable of displaying one or more Emacs frames (see [Frame Type](/docs/elisp/Frame-Type)).

Terminals have no read syntax. They print in hash notation giving the terminal’s ordinal number and its TTY device file name.

```lisp
(get-device-terminal nil)
     ⇒ #<terminal 1 on /dev/tty>
```
