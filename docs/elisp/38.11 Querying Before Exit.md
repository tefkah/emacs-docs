slug: Query-Before-Exit
---

When Emacs exits, it terminates all its subprocesses. For subprocesses that run a program, it sends them the `SIGHUP` signal; connections are simply closed. Because subprocesses may be doing valuable work, Emacs normally asks the user to confirm that it is ok to terminate them. Each process has a query flag, which, if non-`nil`, says that Emacs should ask for confirmation before exiting and thus killing that process. The default for the query flag is `t`, meaning *do* query.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **process-query-on-exit-flag** *process*

This returns the query flag of `process`.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **set-process-query-on-exit-flag** *process flag*

This function sets the query flag of `process` to `flag`. It returns `flag`.

Here is an example of using `set-process-query-on-exit-flag` on a shell process to avoid querying:

```lisp
(set-process-query-on-exit-flag (get-process "shell") nil)
     ⇒ nil
```

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **confirm-kill-processes**

If this user option is set to `t` (the default), then Emacs asks for confirmation before killing processes on exit. If it is `nil`, Emacs kills processes without confirmation, i.e., the query flag of all processes is ignored.
