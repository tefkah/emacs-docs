slug: Marker-Insertion-Types
---

When you insert text directly at the place where a marker points, there are two possible ways to relocate that marker: it can point before the inserted text, or point after it. You can specify which one a given marker should do by setting its *insertion type*. Note that use of `insert-before-markers` ignores markers’ insertion types, always relocating a marker to point after the inserted text.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **set-marker-insertion-type** *marker type*

This function sets the insertion type of marker `marker` to `type`. If `type` is `t`, `marker` will advance when text is inserted at its position. If `type` is `nil`, `marker` does not advance when text is inserted there.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **marker-insertion-type** *marker*

This function reports the current insertion type of `marker`.

All functions that create markers without accepting an argument that specifies the insertion type, create them with insertion type `nil` (see [Creating Markers](/docs/elisp/Creating-Markers)). Also, the mark has, by default, insertion type `nil`.
