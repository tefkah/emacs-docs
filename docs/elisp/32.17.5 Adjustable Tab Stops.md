This section explains the mechanism for user-specified tab stops and the mechanisms that use and set them. The name “tab stops" is used because the feature is similar to that of the tab stops on a typewriter. The feature works by inserting an appropriate number of spaces and tab characters to reach the next tab stop column; it does not affect the display of tab characters in the buffer (see [Usual Display](Usual-Display)). Note that the `TAB` character as input uses this tab stop feature only in a few major modes, such as Text mode. See [Tab Stops](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Tab-Stops) in The GNU Emacs Manual.

### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **tab-to-tab-stop**

This command inserts spaces or tabs before point, up to the next tab stop column defined by `tab-stop-list`.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **tab-stop-list**

This variable defines the tab stop columns used by `tab-to-tab-stop`. It should be either `nil`, or a list of increasing integers, which need not be evenly spaced. The list is implicitly extended to infinity through repetition of the interval between the last and penultimate elements (or `tab-width` if the list has fewer than two elements). A value of `nil` means a tab stop every `tab-width` columns.

Use `M-x edit-tab-stops` to edit the location of tab stops interactively.
