slug: Decompression

When `auto-compression-mode` is enabled, Emacs automatically uncompresses compressed files when you visit them, and automatically recompresses them if you alter and save them. See [Compressed Files](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Compressed-Files) in The GNU Emacs Manual.

The above feature works by calling an external executable (e.g., `gzip`). Emacs can also be compiled with support for built-in decompression using the zlib library, which is faster than calling an external program.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **zlib-available-p**

This function returns non-`nil` if built-in zlib decompression is available.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **zlib-decompress-region** *start end \&optional allow-partial*

This function decompresses the region between `start` and `end`, using built-in zlib decompression. The region should contain data that were compressed with gzip or zlib. On success, the function replaces the contents of the region with the decompressed data. If `allow-partial` is `nil` or omitted, then on failure, the function leaves the region unchanged and returns `nil`. Otherwise, it returns the number of bytes that were not decompressed and replaces the region text by whatever data was successfully decompressed. This function can be called only in unibyte buffers.
