slug: Point

The cursor in the selected window shows the location where most editing commands take effect, which is called *point*[^1]. Many Emacs commands move point to different places in the buffer; for example, you can place point by clicking mouse button 1 (normally the left button) at the desired location.

By default, the cursor in the selected window is drawn as a solid block and appears to be *on* a character, but you should think of point as *between* two characters; it is situated *before* the character under the cursor. For example, if your text looks like ‘`frob`’ with the cursor over the ‘`b`’, then point is between the ‘`o`’ and the ‘`b`’. If you insert the character ‘`!`’ at that position, the result is ‘`fro!b`’, with point between the ‘`!`’ and the ‘`b`’. Thus, the cursor remains over the ‘`b`’, as before.

If you are editing several files in Emacs, each in its own buffer, each buffer has its own value of point. A buffer that is not currently displayed remembers its value of point if you later display it again. Furthermore, if a buffer is displayed in multiple windows, each of those windows has its own value of point.

See [Cursor Display](/docs/emacs/Cursor-Display), for options that control how Emacs displays the cursor.

[^1]: The term “point" comes from the character ‘`.`’, which was the command in TECO (the language in which the original Emacs was written) for accessing the editing position.
