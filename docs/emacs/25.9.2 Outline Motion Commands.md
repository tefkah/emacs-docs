slug: Outline-Motion

Outline mode provides special motion commands that move backward and forward to heading lines.

### `C-c C-n`

Move point to the next visible heading line (`outline-next-visible-heading`).

### `C-c C-p`

Move point to the previous visible heading line (`outline-previous-visible-heading`).

### `C-c C-f`

Move point to the next visible heading line at the same level as the one point is on (`outline-forward-same-level`).

### `C-c C-b`

Move point to the previous visible heading line at the same level (`outline-backward-same-level`).

### `C-c C-u`

Move point up to a lower-level (more inclusive) visible heading line (`outline-up-heading`).

All of the above commands accept numeric arguments as repeat counts. For example, `C-c C-f`, when given an argument, moves forward that many visible heading lines on the same level, and `C-c C-u` with an argument moves out of that many nested levels.
