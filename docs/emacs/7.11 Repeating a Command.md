slug: Repeating

Many simple commands, such as those invoked with a single key or with `M-x command-name RET`<!-- /@w -->, can be repeated by invoking them with a numeric argument that serves as a repeat count (see [Arguments](/docs/emacs/Arguments)). However, if the command you want to repeat prompts for input, or uses a numeric argument in another way, that method won’t work.

The command `C-x z` (`repeat`) provides another way to repeat an Emacs command many times. This command repeats the previous Emacs command, whatever that was. Repeating a command uses the same arguments that were used before; it does not read new arguments each time.

To repeat the command more than once, type additional `z`’s: each `z` repeats the command one more time. Repetition ends when you type a character other than `z` or press a mouse button.

For example, suppose you type `C-u 2 0 C-d` to delete 20 characters. You can repeat that command (including its argument) three additional times, to delete a total of 80 characters, by typing `C-x z z z`. The first `C-x z` repeats the command once, and each subsequent `z` repeats it once again.
