Sebastian Rose has written a JavaScript program especially designed to allow two different ways of viewing HTML files created with Org. One is an *Info*-like mode where each section is displayed separately and navigation can be done with the `n` and `p` keys, and some other keys as well, press `?` for an overview of the available keys. The second one has a *folding* view, much like Org provides inside Emacs. The script is available at [https://orgmode.org/org-info.js](https://orgmode.org/org-info.js) and the documentation at [https://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/](https://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/). The script is hosted on [https://orgmode.org](https://orgmode.org), but for reliability, prefer installing it on your own web server.

To use this program, just add this line to the Org file:

```lisp
#+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil
```

The HTML header now has the code needed to automatically invoke the script. For setting options, use the syntax from the above line for options described below:

### ‘`path:`’

The path to the script. The default is to grab the script from [https://orgmode.org/org-info.js](https://orgmode.org/org-info.js), but you might want to have a local copy and use a path like ‘`../scripts/org-info.js`’.

### ‘`view:`’

Initial view when the website is first shown. Possible values are:

|              |                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‘`info`’     | Info-like interface with one section per page          |
| ‘`overview`’ | Folding interface, initially showing only top-level    |
| ‘`content`’  | Folding interface, starting with all headlines visible |
| ‘`showall`’  | Folding interface, all headlines and text visible      |

### ‘`sdepth:`’

Maximum headline level still considered as an independent section for info and folding modes. The default is taken from `org-export-headline-levels`, i.e., the ‘`H`’ switch in ‘`OPTIONS`’. If this is smaller than in `org-export-headline-levels`, each info/folding section can still contain child headlines.

### ‘`toc:`’

Should the table of contents *initially* be visible? Even when ‘`nil`’, you can always get to the “toc" with `i`.

### ‘`tdepth:`’

The depth of the table of contents. The defaults are taken from the variables `org-export-headline-levels` and `org-export-with-toc`.

### ‘`ftoc:`’

Does the CSS of the page specify a fixed position for the “toc"? If yes, the toc is displayed as a section.

### ‘`ltoc:`’

Should there be short contents (children) in each section? Make this ‘`above`’ if the section should be above initial text.

### ‘`mouse:`’

Headings are highlighted when the mouse is over them. Should be ‘`underline`’ (default) or a background color like ‘`#cccccc`’.

### ‘`buttons:`’

Should view-toggle buttons be everywhere? When ‘`nil`’ (the default), only one such button is present.

You can choose default values for these options by customizing the variable `org-infojs-options`. If you always want to apply the script to your pages, configure the variable `org-export-html-use-infojs`.
