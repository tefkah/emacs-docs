You can insert and follow links that have Org syntax not only in Org, but in any Emacs buffer. For this, Org provides two functions: `org-insert-link-global` and `org-open-at-point-global`.

You might want to bind them to globally available keys. See [Activation](/docs/org/Activation) for some advice.
