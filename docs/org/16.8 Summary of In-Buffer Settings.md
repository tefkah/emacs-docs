slug: In_002dbuffer-Settings
---

In-buffer settings start with ‘`#+`’, followed by a keyword, a colon, and then a word for each setting. Org accepts multiple settings on the same line. Org also accepts multiple lines for a keyword. This manual describes these settings throughout. A summary follows here.

`C-c C-c` activates any changes to the in-buffer settings. Closing and reopening the Org file in Emacs also activates the changes.

### ‘`#+ARCHIVE: %s_done::`’

Sets the archive location of the agenda file. The corresponding variable is `org-archive-location`.

### ‘`#+CATEGORY`’

Sets the category of the agenda file, which applies to the entire document.

### ‘`#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM ...`’

Set the default format for columns view. This format applies when columns view is invoked in locations where no ‘`COLUMNS`’ property applies.

### ‘`#+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...`’

Set file-local values for constants that table formulas can use. This line sets the local variable `org-table-formula-constants-local`. The global version of this variable is `org-table-formula-constants`.

### ‘`#+FILETAGS: :tag1:tag2:tag3:`’

Set tags that all entries in the file inherit from, including the top-level entries.

### ‘`#+LINK: linkword replace`’

Each line specifies one abbreviation for one link. Use multiple ‘`LINK`’ keywords for more, see [Link Abbreviations](Link-Abbreviations). The corresponding variable is `org-link-abbrev-alist`.

### ‘`#+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default`’

This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities. All three must be either letters A–Z or numbers 0–9. The highest priority must have a lower ASCII number than the lowest priority.

### ‘`#+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value`’

This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the current buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a property.

### ‘`#+SETUPFILE: file`’

The setup file or a URL pointing to such file is for additional in-buffer settings. Org loads this file and parses it for any settings in it only when Org opens the main file. If URL is specified, the contents are downloaded and stored in a temporary file cache. `C-c C-c` on the settings line parses and loads the file, and also resets the temporary file cache. Org also parses and loads the document during normal exporting process. Org parses the contents of this document as if it was included in the buffer. It can be another Org file. To visit the file—not a URL—use `C-c '` while point is on the line with the file name.

### ‘`#+STARTUP:`’

Startup options Org uses when first visiting a file.

The first set of options deals with the initial visibility of the outline tree. The corresponding variable for global default settings is `org-startup-folded` with a default value of `showeverything`.

| ‘`showall`’        | No folding on any entry.   |
| ‘`showeverything`’ | Show even drawer contents. |

Dynamic virtual indentation is controlled by the variable `org-startup-indented`[^1].

### ‘`#+TAGS: TAG1(c1) TAG2(c2)`’

These lines (several such lines are allowed) specify the valid tags in this file, and (potentially) the corresponding *fast tag selection* keys. The corresponding variable is `org-tag-alist`.

### ‘`#+TODO:`’

### ‘`#+SEQ_TODO:`’

### ‘`#+TYP_TODO:`’

These lines set the TODO keywords and their interpretation in the current file. The corresponding variable is `org-todo-keywords`.

[^1]: Note that Org Indent mode also sets the `wrap-prefix` property, such that Visual Line mode (or purely setting `word-wrap`) wraps long lines, including headlines, correctly indented.
